# Yapper App
# Project Documentation
## 1. Addressing Feedback:
Our TA feedback was to add more details to our User Stroies & break them down into more actionable tasks in the Backlog, which we completed (see Backlog)...

## 2. Code Base of Prototype:
Look to source code in Repo.

## 3. Code Documentation:
Look to source code in Repo (we included comments at the top of every important Class / Fragment / Activity, plus JavaDocs comments for methods).

## 4. Test Cases:
Our app currently does not include unit tests because:

Most methods do not have return variables, making them unsuitable for unit testing.
Many methods are tightly integrated with Firestore, which requires interaction with a live database.
The Unit Tests, however, are integrated with Github Actions. We will write more for our PP4 submission. In terms of UI Tests, it can be run locally.

## 5. Object-Oriented Design:

## 6. Product Backlog:
Look to Backlog.

## 7. User Interface Mockups and Storyboard Sequences:
Our app closely follows the Figma design created during the planning phase. There have been no significant changes or deviations from the original design. Notfication Page Changes can be found here: https://www.figma.com/design/LvuX3OONMMB8AZHy7H7evs/Yapper-App?node-id=0-1
