# Project Documentation

## 1. Addressing Feedback: 
Our TA feedback was to add more details to our User Stroies & break them down into more actionable tasks in the Backlog, which we completed (see Backlog)...

## 2. Code Base of Prototype: 
Look to source code in Repo.

## 3. Code Documentation: 
Look to source code in Repo (we included comments at the top of every important Class / Fragment / Activity, plus JavaDocs comments for methods).

## 4. Test Cases:
Our app currently does not include unit tests because:

1. Most methods do not have return variables, making them unsuitable for unit testing.
2. Many methods are tightly integrated with Firestore, which requires interaction with a live database.

The Unit Tests, however, are integrated with Github Actions. We will write more for our PP4 submission. 
In terms of UI Tests, it can be run locally.

## 5. Object-Oriented Design:

## 6. Product Backlog: 
Look to Backlog.

## 7. User Interface Mockups and Storyboard Sequences:

Our app closely follows the Figma design created during the planning phase. There have been no significant changes or deviations from the original design.
