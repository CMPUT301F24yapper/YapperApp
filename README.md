# Project Documentation

## Design Alignment with Figma

Our app closely follows the Figma design created during the planning phase. There have been no significant changes or deviations from the original design.

## Project Planning

You can find our project planning document [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r3gN46TJsJ_52aZahp9-sxnLIFVKG7LOSuvvvMBYGXY/edit?tab=t.0).  

## Meeting Minutes

All meeting minutes are organized and available in this folder: [Meeting Minutes Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1X8VXuVYss5d5FKfLBXnMyWdaYjrwcLZw?usp=sharing).

## Unit Tests

Our app currently does not include unit tests because:

1. Most methods do not have return variables, making them unsuitable for unit testing.
2. Many methods are tightly integrated with Firestore, which requires interaction with a live database.
