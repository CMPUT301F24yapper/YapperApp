# Yapper App
# Project Documentation
## 1. Addressing Feedback:
Our TA feedback was to better implement the testing component (more UI tests),

## 2. Code Base of Prototype:
Look to source code in Repo.

## 3. Code Documentation:

## 4. Test Cases:
Our app includes unit tests, which are integrated with GitHub Actions to ensure core functionality is validated during development, and UI tests, which can be run locally to verify user interface interactions. These tests help maintain the appâ€™s reliability and user experience. We used mockito to mock objects for unit testing.

## 5. Object-Oriented Design:

## 6. Product Backlog:
Look to Backlog. 

## 7. User Interface Mockups and Storyboard Sequences:
Our app closely follows the Figma design created during the planning phase. There have been a couple of deviations from the original design. Changes can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/design/LvuX3OONMMB8AZHy7H7evs/Yapper-App?node-id=0-1).

## 8. Sprint Planning and Reviews:
