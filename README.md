# Yapper App
# Project Documentation
## 1. Addressing Feedback:
Our TA feedback was to add more details to our User Stories & break them down into more actionable tasks in the Backlog, which we completed (see Backlog)...

## 2. Code Base of Prototype:
Look to source code in Repo.

## 3. Code Documentation:
Look to source code in Repo (we included comments at the top of every important Class / Fragment / Activity, plus JavaDocs comments for methods).
We were having trouble with Javadocs generation to Github even with correct usage of Javadocs, so for now we have it saved in Google Drive (Link: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1H-nh6iOYAUdf_WoMnQzXoz6IrXrxDXa2)

## 4. Test Cases:
Our app currently does not include unit tests because: most methods do not have return variables, making them unsuitable for unit testing, & many methods are tightly integrated with Firestore, which requires interaction with a live database.
The Unit Tests, however, are integrated with Github Actions. We will write more for our PP4 submission. In terms of UI Tests, it can be run locally.

## 5. Object-Oriented Design:

## 6. Product Backlog:
Look to Backlog. 

## 7. User Interface Mockups and Storyboard Sequences:
Our app closely follows the Figma design created during the planning phase. There have been a couple of deviations from the original design. Changes can be found here: https://www.figma.com/design/LvuX3OONMMB8AZHy7H7evs/Yapper-App?node-id=0-1

## 8. Sprint Planning and Reviews:
