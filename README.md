# Yapper App
# Project Documentation
## 1. Addressing Feedback:
Our TA feedback was to better implement the testing component (more UI tests),

## 2. Code Base of Prototype:
Look to source code in Repo.

## 3. Code Documentation:

## 4. Test Cases:
Our app includes unit tests, integrated with GitHub Actions, using Mockito to mock dependencies for isolated testing. We also perform UI tests with Espresso, which can be run locally on an emulator. To ensure consistent UI test results, animations must be switched off through the Developer Options in the Android emulator.

## 5. Object-Oriented Design:

## 6. Product Backlog:
Look to Backlog. 

## 7. User Interface Mockups and Storyboard Sequences:
Our app closely follows the Figma design created during the planning phase. There have been a couple of deviations from the original design. Changes can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/design/LvuX3OONMMB8AZHy7H7evs/Yapper-App?node-id=0-1).
